# TechDetect Attendance Manager
TechDetect is a python open-cv powered facial detection program that connects to a mySQL database and flask site to allow teams, schools, or corporations to keep tract of attendance using facial detection. The system was developed during my 2022 STEM@GTRI Internship.
